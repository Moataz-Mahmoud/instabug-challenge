# LinkedIn Test Cases

### Notes

- All the test cases share some of the preconditions (they are stated
   in the next section).
   2. There are some duplicate steps. In a Test Management Tool, I would create **shared steps** and add them there. But no space for that in
   MD files.
   3. Every section contains some numbered test cases.
   4. Every test case contains steps, and the expected result of each step is mentioned next to it in brackets [].
   5. There are hundreds of test cases in each section. But I just mentioned a sample in each section.
   6. The test cases mentioned below are not ordered. You should deal with them as two different test suites. One for the search tests, and
   another for the profile ones.

### Preconditions
